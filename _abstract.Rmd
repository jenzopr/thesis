Cancer is a complex and dynamic disease that manifests in ~100 distinct cancer types from multiple tissues, cell types and mechanisms. Research from the last decade has revealed vast heterogeneity within and between cancer types that currently hampers effective treatment and calls for personalized strategies in cancer therapy. This thesis develops methodology for detection and molecular characterization of cancer subtypes by focusing on the analysis of data from high-throughput experiments. Its objectives are to provide algorithms for rapid detection and quantification of microRNAs, analysis and visualization of DNA methylation and to investigate the cellular and molecular origin of embryonal rhabdosarcoma (ERMS), a rare and aggressive childhood cancer.

Two new computational methods were implemented and evaluated by replicating previously published findings. DNA copy number alterations and gene expression estimates were obtained from a novel model system for ERMS and were integrated with cancer patient data. Examination of tumor specimen unambigously showed that the origin of ERMS lies within tissue-resident muscle stem cells, and data analysis revealed a diverse molecular basis that confirms cancer heterogeneity. Surprisingly, it was discovered that activation of zygotic Dux factors describe a novel cancer subtype that is not limited to ERMS, but occurs in a broad range of human cancer. 

Based on the results, it can be concluded that computational methods and integrative data analysis can prove useful to delineate the origin of cancer types and provide a valuable starting point for selection of relevant therapeutic targets. However, future research is needed to establish more holistic analysis approaches and transfer findings into clinical routines.
