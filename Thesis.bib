	volume = {73},
	issn = {0027-8424},
	abstract = {A definitive test for developmental totipotency of mouse malignant teratocarcinoma cells was conducted by cloning singly injected cells in genetically marked blastocysts. Totipotency was conclusively shown in an adult mosaic female whose tumor-strain cells had made substantial contributions to all of the wide range of its somatic tissues analyzed; the clonally propagated cell lineage had therefore differentiated in numerous normal directions. The test cells were from "cores" of embryoid bodies of a euploid, chromosomally male (X/Y), ascites tumor grown only in vivo by transplantation for 8 years. The capacity of cells from the same source to differentiate, in a phenotypic male, into reproductively functional sperms, has been shown in our previous experiments [(1975) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 3585-3589]. Cells from this transplant line therefore provide material suitable for projected somatic and germ-line genetic analyses of mammalian differentiation based on "cycling" of mutation-carrying tumor cells through developing embryos. In some animals obtained from single-cell injections tumor-derived cells were sporadically distributed in developmentally unrelated tissues. These cases can be accounted for by delayed and haphazard cellular integration, and by a marked degree of sustained cellular developmental flexibility in early mammalian development, irrespective of certain classical "germ-layer" designations. All mosaic mice obtained have thus far been free of teratomas. In one case, the injected stem cell contributed only to the pancreas and gave rise to a malignancy resembling pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The high modal frequency of euploidy in these individually tested cells thus tends to indicate that a near-normal chromosome complement is sufficient for total restoration of orderly gene expression in a normal embryonic environment; it may also be necessary for teratoma stem-cell proliferation to be terminated there.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small 21\&ndash;24 nucleotide RNAs that are capable of regulating multiple signaling pathways across multiple tissues. MicroRNAs are dynamically regulated and change in expression levels during periods of early development, tissue regeneration, cancer, and various other disease states. Recently, microRNAs have been isolated from whole serum and muscle biopsies to identify unique diagnostic signatures for specific neuromuscular disease states. Functional studies of microRNAs in cell lines and animal models of neuromuscular diseases have elucidated their importance in contributing to neuromuscular disease progression and pathologies. The ability of microRNAs to alter the expression of an entire signaling pathway opens up their unique ability to be used as potential therapeutic entry points for the treatment of disease. Here, we will review the recent findings of key microRNAs and their dysregulation in various neuromuscular diseases. Additionally, we will highlight the current strategies being used to regulate the expression of key microRNAs as they have become important players in the clinical treatment of some of the neuromuscular diseases.},
