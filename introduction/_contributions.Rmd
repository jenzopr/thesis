This thesis comprises three peer-reviewed publications, which are presented in chronological order.

The publication introduces MIRPIPE, an algorithm for rapid miRNA detection and quantification from high-throughput sequencing data. The algorithms takes raw data from *total RNA sequencing* as input and initially perfoms quality control by filtering out reads with low quality base calls, too long or too short reads that do not match the length assumption of mature miRNAs (18 - 28*nt*), and removing sequencing adapter contamination from the *3'*-end. MIRPIPE optionally removes unique, or low abundant reads frequently denoting remaining sequencing errors or miRNA variations below the detection limit and clusters reads sharing the same *5'*-end to properly handle miRNAs steming from the same gene but imperfectly digested by Drosha/Dicer (isoMiRs). MIRPIPE builds a graph from homolgy searches against a reference database with reference miRNAs as nodes and edges between two nodes if read(s) support two reference miRNAs equally well. The unique approach permits inclusion of reads that otherwise cannot be matched uniquely and detects miRNA families as connected components in the graph. Quantification results, i.e. counts per miRNA family and miRNA cluster (isoMiRs) can readily be used for downstream differential expression analysis.

The publication introduces ADMIRE, a pipeline for differential methylation analysis within genomic regions. The algorithm takes raw data from *Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips* and initially filters single CpG probes based on low signal-to-noise ratios in a variable proportion of analysed samples. ADMIRE offers several techniques to perform between-sample normalization, e.g. by regressing out variability observed between control probes, before calculating two one-sided two-sample rank tests per CpG probe and between any two sample groups. Intentionally, two p-values are obtained per CpG probe, indicating lower or higher methylation in either group. ADMIRE allows subsequent combination of spatially correlated p-values into arbitrary genomic regions using weighted Z-scores and as well controls the familywise error rate to accomplish multiple testing correction. Differential methylation results are used to perform gene set enrichment analysis, if genomic regions can be meaningfully related to genes, to facilitate target selection in clinical settings. Further, most significantly altered regions are readily visualised and exported for use in genome browsers or in spreadsheet viewers.
