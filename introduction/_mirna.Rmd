### Small RNA mediated carcinogenesis {#mirna}

Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides and serve numerous roles in negative gene regulation. In animals, most miRNAs exhibit their regulatory role through imperfect binding of a sequence in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of messenger RNA from target genes. Complementary binding can either repress translation of target gene(s) or mediate mRNA degradation, through a mechanism similar to RNA interference in plants [@jones-rhoades_micrornas_2006].  

MiRNA biogenesis begins with the transcription of either independent miRNA genes or intronic regions from protein-coding genes into large precursor molecules (pri-miRNAs). Imperfect base-paring of folding pri-miRNAs results in hairpin structures that are further cleaved by an RNase III type endonuclease (Drosha, RN3) together with a double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) protein [@han_drosha-dgcr8_2004] into ~70 nucleotide hairpins called pre-miRNAs, leaving a short characteristic single-stranded overhang at the 3'-end of pre-miRNAs. Exportin 5 recognizes such an overhang and undertakes transport of pre-miRNAs to the cytoplasm [@yi_exportin-5_2003], where a second complex of Dicer, a RNase III type enzyme, and TRBP, a dsRBD protein, cleave the pre-miRNA twice into a miRNA duplex [@chendrimada_trbp_2005]. One strand (the mature miRNA) preferentially enters the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), while the other is degraded, but would have been competent for miRNA-mediated silencing as well [@schwarz_asymmetry_2003]. Imperfect double-strand pairing of pre-miRNAs as well as imperfect digestion by Drosha and Dicer result in miRNAs with varying 3'- (silent modification, *isomiR*) or 5'-ends, that might affect complementary binding, representing a challenge during the computational miRNA quantification following RNASeq. 

Forward genetic experiments have revealed great importance not only of the miRNA machinery, exemplified by muscle-specific knockout of Dicer leading to complete embryonic development but perinatal death [@bernstein_dicer_2003], but also of numerous individual miRNAs with roles processes, like timing of development [@abrahante_caenorhabditis_2003], differentiation [@chen_micrornas_2004] and growth control [@brennecke_bantam_2003]. Since phenotypic consequence remains elusive for the vast majority of miRNA, also computational approaches can and have been used to elucidate miRNA function (Cite). 


Consequently, myomiRs (miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206) are repeatedly reported to be misregulated in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) (see (Alexander, Kunkel) for a review).
