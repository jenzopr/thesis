Understanding the cellular hierarchy in normal tissue can lead to insights in emergence of intertumoral heterogeneity, . Two mechanisms have been put forward to explain intertumoral heterogeneity:

In contrast to intertumoral heterogeneity, intratumoral heterogeneity describes the biological variation within a tumor. Such heterogeneity may be composed of *functional* heterogeneity, that is caused by genetic diversity among tumor subclones, *epigenetic* heterogeneity, e.g. caused by changes in chromatin structure and dynamics, and heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, which is shaped by different infiltrating cell types. All three components can affect stemness of cancer stem cells, jointly or individually over time, and thereby influence tumor progression and clinical relevance.
