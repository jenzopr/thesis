The discovery of dynamics and complexity of cancer-causing mechanisms, including dysregulated expression of regulatory factors (miRNAs, transcription factors), structural genomic and epigenomic alterations or disruption of normal tissue context, has benefited largely from technological and computational advancements in the last decade. Nowadays, cancer research faces unique challenges to manage, analyse and integrate complex and numerous datasets to identify relevant therapeutic targets and support precise treatment of cancer patients. On one hand, work presented in thesis seeks to provide missing methodological development within the field of computational analysis of cancer -omics data. On the other hand, work presented here investigates the molecular and cellular origin of a childhood cancer, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and integrates data from genomics and transcriptomics with previously published findings to detect a novel cancer subtype.

Two algorithms have been contributed to enable characterisation and quantification of the entire regulatory repertoire of miRNAs from NGS experiments, and to facilitate analysis of DNA methylation. Importantly, the unique statistical approach applied during DNA methylation analysis overcomes previous limitations and enables differential analysis within arbitrary genomic regions in a case-control setting. Both algorithms are designed to work with all types of input from RNA sequencing or high-density DNA methylation arrays, respectively, and might be beneficial for future studies investigating the molecular origin of different types of cancer. By employment of genetic labelling and direct oncogenic transformation of muscle stem cells, work in this thesis unambiguously demonstrated that the cellular origin of ERMS lies within muscle stem cells. Further, analysis of data from genomics and transcriptomics in mouse was integrated with gene expression studies from ~10,000 human cancer patients to disclose the molecular origin of ERMS and discover a novel cancer subtype across a broad range of human cancer driven by oncogenic activation of zygotic Dux factors. To better understand how zygotic Dux factors confer tumour initiation, the thesis additionally provides evidence for Duxbl-conferred epigenetic plasticity and cellular transformation. Although an additional oncogenic hit is likely required for tumour metastasis, insights into tumour initiation is a useful starting point for selection of relevant therapeutic targets.

Taken together, findings and conclusions from this thesis allow future research in the areas of molecular biology, computational biology and precision medicine. For example, researching the role of Dux transcription factors for zygotic gene activation and cancer initiation has only started, leaving the definition of their gene regulatory network and their role in epigenetic restructuring for further investigation. Effective precision medicine for cancer treatment currently lacks suitable (computational) methods for data integration, which include different mechanisms of cancer initiation and the dynamics of cancer progression. Future research is needed to properly evaluate and select tailored treatment strategies based on identified cancer subtype properties, drug susceptibility, presence of neo-antigens, synthetic dosage lethality or unique tumour microenvironments. Technological advancement has just begun to enable integrative studies that are able to produce results for functional testing. So far, holistic analyses are not yet feasible in clinical routines, but might become available in a few years. Towards this end, the current thesis has contributed a certain share.
