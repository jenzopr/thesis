The discovery of dynamics and complexity of cancer-causing mechanisms, including the misexpression of regulatory factors (miRNAs, transcription factors), structural genomic and epigenomic alterations or disruption of normal tissue context, has benefited largely from technological and computational advancements in the last decade. Nowadays, cancer research faces unique challenges to manage, analyse and integrate complex and numerous datasets to identify relevant therapeutic targets and support clinical cancer treatment. This thesis aimed at providing methodological development within the scope of computational cancer biology and set out to conduct an integrative analysis to investigate the molecular and cellular origin of a childhood cancer, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

Two algorithms have been contributed to enable characterization and quantification of the entire regulatory repertoire of miRNAs from high throughput sequencing experiments, and to facilitate analysis of DNA methylation. Importantly, the unique statistical approach applied during DNA methylation analysis overcomes previous limitations and enables differential analysis within arbitrary genomic regions in a case-control setting. Both algorithms are designed to work in general with all input from RNA sequencing or high-density DNA methylation arrays, respectively, and can prove beneficial in future studies investigating the molecular origin of many kinds of cancer. By employment of genetic labelling and direct oncogenic transformation of muscle stem cells, work in this thesis has unambiguously shown that the cellular origin of ERMS lies within muscle stem cells. Further, analysis of genomic mutations (somatic and DNA copy number variation) in mouse was integrated with gene expression studies from ~10,000 human cancer patients to disclose the molecular origin of ERMS and discover a novel cancer subtype across a broad range of human cancer driven by oncogenic activation of zygotic Dux factors. To better understand how zygotic Dux factors confer tumour initiation, work in this thesis additionally provides evidence for Duxbl-conferred epigenetic plasticity and cellular transformation. Although an additional oncogenic hit is likely to be required for tumour metastasis, insights into tumour initiation can prove useful as a starting point for selection of relevant therapeutic targets.

Taken together, findings and conclusions from this thesis allow future research in the areas of molecular biology, computational biology and personalised medicine. For example, the role of Dux transcription factors has been only vaguely defined for zygotic gene activation and cancer initiation and leaves the definition of their gene regulatory network and their role in epigenetic restructuring for further investigation. Effective personalised medicine for cancer treatment currently lacks suitable (computational) methods for data integration that consider different mechanisms of cancer initiation and the dynamics of cancer progression. Future research is needed to properly evaluate and select personalised treatment strategies that are based on emerging cancer properties, like drug susceptibility, presence of neo-antigens, synthetic dosage lethality or unique tumour microenvironments. Technological advancement has just begun to enable integrative studies that can produce results for functional testing, but holistic analyses are not yet feasible in clinical routines. This thesis seeks to contribute its share towards this end.
