### The stem cell as a cancer cell of origin {#csc}

Similar to maintenance of tissue identity, the development of normal tissue requires complex crosstalk between cells, their local environment and the whole organ. Migration and proper localization of precursor cells is a prerequisite for formation of mature descendants that can carry out their tissue-specific function. The specific pattern of a cells tissue-forming division(s) has been termed its *lineage* [@chisholmCellLineage2001]. Dissection of such cell lineages revealed further a hierarchical organization and helped to identify interactions and molecular signalling pathways that are important in tissue development and diseases. However, unidirectional division alongside the cell lineage would quickly lead to exhaustion of a cells tissue-generative potential and calls for a mechanism like duplicating mitosis as proposed by the physiomitotic theory: **Stem cells** are tissue-specific multipotent precursor cells residing at the apex of a lineage, and are capable of both, the generation of common progenitor cells with increasing lineage commitment and self-renewal, in order to regenerate and sustain the pool of stem cells. The inherent proliferative capacity and the ability to give rise to different, mature cell types renders stem cells particularly fascinating for the study of tissue development, regeneration and in the search for the cellular origin of cancer.

An important distinction has to be made between cancer cells of origin (*i.e.* the normal cell that acquires the first cancer-promoting mutation) and cancer stem cells, *i.e.* a cellular subset within a tumour that exclusively sustains malignant growth [@visvaderCellsOriginCancer2011]. Intertumoural heterogeneity, *i.e.* the variability among discrete tumour types arising from the same tissue, has put forward two hypothesis how cancer stem cells are formed: (1) All tumours originate from common progenitor cells that accumulate different genetic or epigenetic mutations through their extended longevity and therefore result in different tumour types or (2) different cells along the lineage hierarchy that still possess or can re-instigate proliferative capacity or prevent terminal differentiation (e.g. more restricted progenitor cells) constitute different cancer types upon oncogenic transformation (@perez-losadaStemcellHierarchySkin2003a, @visvaderCellsOriginCancer2011 and Fig. \@ref(fig:stem-cell-tumor)). Cells with self-renewal capacity are of paramount importance for tumour growth, as they ensure long-term clonal growth. However, not all cancer cells possess self-renewal capacity and not all cancer cells of origin were bona-fide stem cells. So, how do cancer cells acquire their stemness, if not from normal tissue stem cells?

The mechanism described above inextricably associates lineage descendance and differentiation state of progenitor cells to cancer biology and has been termed *lineage dependency* [@garrawayLineageDependencyLineagesurvival2006]: Activation of the same oncogenic pathway in tumours originating from different cell lineages may profoundly influence tumour phenotype and degree of malignancy. For example, primary human melanocytes transformed with a set of genes formed melanomas that frequently metastasized, while human fibroblasts or epithelial cells transformed with the identical set of genes rarely did [@guptaMelanocyteDifferentiationProgram2005]. Ultimately, therapeutic approaches might exploit *lineage dependency* for context-specific treatment, for example when *synthetic lethality* exists between two genetic factors [@kaelinConceptSyntheticLethality2005].

A straightforward approach to evaluate the oncogenic capacity of different lineage stem and progenitor cell populations relies on reproducible separation of functionally defined subpopulations using e.g. cell sorting techniques. Relevant oncogenic lesions are introduced *ex vivo*, together with a fluorescent reporter, into each precursor cell population and genetically altered cells are transplanted orthotopically into immunocompromised mice. Emergence of pre-neoplastic or neoplastic tissue from transduced subpopulations serves as readout for evaluation of oncogenic potential for each subpopulation. Complimentary, and with sufficient knowledge about cell-specific promoters, *in vivo* conditional targeting of cell populations is also conceivable. This approach makes use of genetic mouse models to conditionally activate either an oncogene or inactivate a tumour suppressor gene, e.g. by Cre-mediated deletion, in different lineage subpopulations. Depending on the activated cell-specific promoter, different cancer subtypes might arise and reveal the cellular origin of the specific cancer subtype from within the cell lineage [@hayashiEfficientRecombinationDiverse2002;@visvaderCellsOriginCancer2011]. However, for many tissues and organs, established lineages and knowledge of cell specific promoters are missing, and therefore hamper the approach described above.
