### The stem cell as a cancer cell of origin {#csc}

Similar to maintenance of tissue identity, the development of normal tissue requires complex crosstalk between cells, their local environment and the whole organ. Migration and proper localization of precursor cells is a prerequisite for formation of mature descendants that can carry out their tissue-specific function. The specific pattern of a cells tissue-forming division(s) has been termed its *lineage* [@chisholmCellLineage2001]. Furthermore, dissection of such cell lineages revealed a hierarchical organisation and helped to identify interactions and molecular signalling pathways that are important in tissue development and diseases. However, unidirectional division alongside the cell lineage would quickly lead to exhaustion of a cells tissue-generative potential and therefor calls for a mechanism such as duplicating mitosis as proposed by the physiomitotic theory: **Stem cells** are tissue-specific multipotent precursor cells residing at the apex of a lineage, and are capable of both (i), generation of common progenitor cells with increasing lineage commitment and (ii) self-renewal to regenerate and sustain the pool of stem cells. The inherent proliferative capacity and the ability to give rise to different, mature cell types renders stem cells particularly fascinating for the study of tissue development, regeneration and in the search for the cellular origin of cancer.

An important distinction has to be made between the origin of cancer cells (*i.e.* the normal cell that acquires the first cancer-promoting alteration) and cancer stem cells, *i.e.* a cellular subset within a tumour that exclusively sustains malignant growth [@visvaderCellsOriginCancer2011]. Intertumoural heterogeneity, *i.e.* the variability among discrete tumour types arising from the same tissue, has put forward two hypothesis how cancer stem cells are formed: (i) All tumours originate from common progenitor cells that accumulate different genetic or epigenetic mutations through their extended longevity and therefore result in different tumour types or (ii) different cells along the lineage hierarchy that still possess or can re-instigate proliferative capacity or prevent terminal differentiation (e.g. more restricted progenitor cells) constitute different cancer cell types including cancer stem cells upon oncogenic transformation (@perez-losadaStemcellHierarchySkin2003a, @visvaderCellsOriginCancer2011 and Fig. \@ref(fig:stem-cell-tumor)a). Cells with self-renewal capacity are of paramount importance for tumour growth as they ensure long-term clonal growth. However, not all cancer cells possess self-renewal capacity and not all cells from which cancer origins are bona-fide stem cells. So, how do cancer cells acquire their stemness, if not from normal tissue stem cells?

The *lineage-dependency* hypothesis [@garrawayLineageDependencyLineagesurvival2006] suggests that many tumours might be dependent on (or *addicted to*) lineage-survival programmes that also operate during normal lineage development. In this view, cancer cells can aquire their stemness from lineage precursor cells, but rely on persistence and deregulation of lineage-specific proliferation and differentiation pathways (Fig. \@ref(fig:stem-cell-tumor)b). The *lineage-dependency* hypothesis inextricably associates lineage descendance and differentiation state of progenitor cells to cancer biology and complements *oncogene addiction*, in which tumour-specific gain-of-function events elicit a dependency on growth signalling that is absent in normal lineage development.

Activation of the same oncogenic pathway in tumours originating from different cell lineages may also profoundly influence tumour phenotype and degree of malignancy. For example, primary human melanocytes transformed with a set of genes form melanomas that frequently metastasize, while human fibroblasts or epithelial cells transformed with the identical set of genes rarely do [@guptaMelanocyteDifferentiationProgram2005]. Ultimately, therapeutic approaches might exploit *lineage dependency* for context-specific treatment, for example when *synthetic lethality* exists between two genetic factors [@kaelinConceptSyntheticLethality2005].

A straightforward approach to evaluate the oncogenic capacity of different lineage stem and progenitor cell populations relies on reproducible separation of functionally defined subpopulations using e.g. cell sorting techniques. Relevant oncogenic lesions are introduced together into different precursor cell populations *ex vivo* with a fluorescent reporter, followed by orthotopical transplatation into immunocompromised mice. Emergence of pre-neoplastic or neoplastic tissue from transduced subpopulations serves as readout for evaluation of oncogenic potential for each subpopulation. Complimentary, and with sufficient knowledge about cell-specific promoters, *in vivo* conditional targeting of cell populations is also conceivable. This approach makes use of genetic mouse models to conditionally activate either an oncogene or inactivate a tumour suppressor gene in different lineage subpopulations, e.g. by Cre-mediated deletion. Depending on the activated cell-specific promoter, different cancer subtypes might arise and reveal the cellular origin of the specific cancer subtype from within the cell lineage [@hayashiEfficientRecombinationDiverse2002;@visvaderCellsOriginCancer2011]. However, established lineages and knowledge of cell specific promoters are missing for many tissues and organs and therefore hamper the approach described above.
