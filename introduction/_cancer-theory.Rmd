The foundation of modern oncology, i.e. cancer classification, diagnosis, therapy and research, was laid out in the early nineteenth century by Johannes Müller, a professor of anatomy and pathology and Director of the Royal Anatomical Museum in Berlin. Using microscopic pathology to examine tissues of *morbid growth*, Müller recognised, for the first time, the cellular structure of cancer and how it resembled the tissue from which the cancerous growth springs. The origin of cancer and its development has since then been subject of debate in several theories, most of which seeking its origin in a transformation of a healthy cell into a disease state characterised by uncoordinated and excessive cell growth.

### Somatic mutations transform cells into cancer cells

While normal cells retain their ability to control the production and release of growth-promoting signals, and thereby provide tissue architecture and homeostasis of cell number, cancer cells are characterised by chronic proliferation and constant entry and progression through the growth-and-division cycle. The somatic mutation theory assumes that molecular events preceed cell transformation and provide the cell with enabling abilities. By such, transformed cancers cells are able to e.g. escape the control of growth supressors, bypass mechanism of induced cell death, delay or avoid entry into cell senescence, induce angiogenesis and/or alter cell-to-cell contacts to activate invasion of surrounding tissue. At the core of this theory, mutations in so-called master genes (e.g. oncogenes or tumor supressor genes) constitute the origin of cancer. 
Molecular alterations in a single somatic cell are passed onto its progeny and therefore must be heritable to enable clonal expansion (elaborate more on this) and promote cancer growth by sequential accumulation of transforming changes. The mechanism of heredity is not limited to genetic alterations but can also be of epigenetic origin, i.e. based on changes in methylation, acetylation or chromatin structure as well (xref). Importantly, heredity exposes cancer cells to natural selection and enables evolutionary mechanisms to act on cancer development. 

The search for transformation-causing genome alterations accelerated through recent advances in high-throughput technologies which led to an impressive accumulation of data from large-scale genome sequencing projects like the [Cancer Genome Project](cancer.sanger.ac.uk) or [The Cancer Genome Atlas](cancergenome.nih.gov). Collectively, both projects list 77 million simple somatic mutations across cancer genomes from nearly 25,000 individuals in the International Cancer Genome Consortium [Data Portal Release 27](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/release_27). However and until today, the search did not reveal a single pattern of genetic alterations that is universal to most cancers. Instead, it revealed tremendous genetic heterogeneity in underlying mechanisms of cancer formation despite very similar phenotypes.

Following the observed genetic heterogeneity among cancer and even within similar cancer types, it can be reasoned that most individual tumors exhibit different genome contexts with alterations in e.g. genes, regulatory elements and genomic topology. Genome context is largely defined by a cells karyotype and together, both observations provide an underpinning for observed heterogeneity in cancer. 
The Genome Theory extends the somatic mutation theory by karyotype heterogeneity and the process of natural selection into a new theory on how somatic cells evolve within individual patients. At the core of the evolutionary mechanism is genome context instability induced by internal (e.g. elicited through somatic mutations) or external (e.g. treatment, environment) stress. As a consequence, genetic or epigenetic alterations increase cell population heterogeneity to ultimately enable natural selection of somatic cells showing high fitness in terms of survival or proliferation. The evolutionary mechanism happens in two steps of karyotypic evolution:
1) the punctuated (unstable) phase, characterised by high genome-level heterogeneity between individual cells and
2) the stepwise (relatively stable) phase, where dominant karyotypes emerge and accumulate minor modifications over time.

The occurence of genome-level alterations in an instable genome context is a stochastic process and therefore the probability of successful progression towards cancer is highest through alterations significantly impacting a cells phenotype. Concomitantly, the stochastic nature complicates the prediction of which pathway will become dominant prior to tumor formation and renders the characterization of individual cancer pathways less meaningful. Ultimetaly, it impedes the formulation of a general mechanism of cancer origin and obscures understanding of how cancer can be managed in classical clinical treatment.

### Disrupted context: Cancer as a tissue-based disease {#development}

Organs and higher-level structures are comprised of tissue with functional (parenchyme) and structural (stroma) parts. Information exchange between cells of a tissue via cell-to-cell contacts, cytokine signalling and the extracellular matrix, a macromolecular scaffold to support surrounding cells, provides context to maintain cell differentiation and tissue structure. Tissue-level interactions are important for embryonic development and morphogenesis, e.g. to provide neccessary mechanical forces for proper tissue formation and hence, are inextricably linked to the 3D structure and developmental history of the underlying tissue. Disruption of tissue organisation is thought to be carcinogenic through entailed disruption of tissue-level interactions. 

The physiomitotic theory of cancer relates the acquisition of mitotic activities to development of cancer by non-regulated cell turnover among normal tissue. Two types of mitosis maintain tissue histology and continuity: duplicating mitosis regenerates a basal pool of undifferentiated cells in a space-restricted duplication area by creating two identical daugther cells. Those cells are constantly consumed in surrounding areas by maturating mitosis, which creates two daughter cells that are more mature than the parent cell and contribute to tissue diversity and functionality via cell differentiation. 
Disrupted tissue organization and regulation may evoke duplicating mitosis at ectopic sites among normal tissue, thereby creating newly and aberrant tissue identity and non-regulated cell turnover and maturation into cancerous tissue. Carcinogenesis is seen as a problem of tissue organization.  

Similarly, the tissue organization field theory argues that interactions among different tissue components cannot be explained on a cellular level and that carcinogenesis cannot be reduced to cellular events. Cancer initiation is preceeded by a carcinogenic event that chronically disrupts reciprocal interactions between stroma and parenchyme of a tissue, but cannot be observed in individual, isolated cells.

A well known example and important feature of interactions of stroma with surrounding cells is the maintenance of polarized epithelial sheets, a basic tissue type that lines outer surfaces of organs and surfaces of inner cavities. Cell polarity is established by interaction with the basement membrane and cell-to-cell contacts, like adherens junctions, gap junctions, tight junctions and desmosomes. Alterations of epithelial sheets, e.g. through wounding and subsequent activation of stromal fibroblasts, can lead to epithelial cell movement and proliferation. Similarly, sustained inflammation and continuous upregulation of factors produced by invading immune cells and enzymes degrading the EMC (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) stimulate proliferative and apoptotic mechanisms, which can lead to selection of apoptosis-resistant, premalignant cells and enhance formation of carcinoma. Loss or downregulation of e-cadherin, an important component of adherens junctions, leads to a premalignant cel type that is prone to invasion and metastasis by passing through a epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, restoration of e-cadherin expression in such cells can suppress cellular transformation.

Experiments have shown that also restoration of context can lead to healthy phenotypes, e.g. normal differentiation is observed when teracarcinoma cells are injected into blastocysts, even after long passaging [@illmensee_totipotency_1976]. Similarly, experiments from 3D culturing with reconstituted basement membranes or co-culturing of malignant cells with normal stroma reverted their carcinogenic properties. In summary, these experiments suggest that normal stroma provides contextual cues that promotes normal tissue identity and restricts proliferation of existing malignant cells. Abnormal stroma function, on the other hand, releases this supression and permits neoplastic transformation. By such, carcinogenesis can possibly be reversed when neoplastic tissue comes into contact with normal tissue or components thereof.
