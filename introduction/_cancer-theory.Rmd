The origin of cancer and its development has been a subject of debate in several theories. In the early nineteenth century, a professor of anatomy and pathology at the Royal Anatomical Museum in Berlin, Johannes MÃ¼ller, recognised for the first time the cellular structure of cancer. Using microscopic pathology, he observed how *morbid growth* resembles the tissue from which the cancerous growth springs. Since then, modern oncology seeks the origin of cancer in a transformation of a healthy cell into a disease state characterized by uncoordinated and excessive cell growth. 

The upcoming sections highlight several theories that provide explanation for different cancer-causing mechanisms with implications for cancer classification, diagnosis, therapy and research.
