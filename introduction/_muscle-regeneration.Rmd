### Skeletal muscle regeneration as a model for stem cell tumor {#regeneration}

The ability of movement is an evolutionary advantage of all animals, and is powered by muscles. Vertebrate locomotion receives its power from striated, skeletal muscle, one of the three major muscle types in the body, that is composed from multiple bundled (fascicles) muscle fibres. Each fibre is a multinucleated muscle cell formed by fusion of differentiated mononuclear muscle cells (myoblast) and exhibits force and movement by coordinated activity of myosin II motor proteins within an actin filament scaffold. Skeletal muscle retains a remarkable ability to regenerate and adapt to changes in requirements, mediated by and dependent on muscle stem cells that reside between the muscle sarcolemma and the basal lamina of individual muscle fibres. Adult muscle stem cells are *bona fide* stem cells, being capable of both, self-renewal and myogenic differentiation, which ultimately leads to differentiated muscle cells. (Almada and Wagers, 2016; Guenther et al., 2013, Braun and Gautel, 2011)

Under homeostasis of uninjured muscle, muscle stem cells are marked by expression of Paired box protein 7 (PAX7), a transcriptional regulator that actively maintains a state of restrained cell cycling called *quiescence*. Upon muscle trauma, e.g. inflicting injury or during chronic regeneration of certain diseases, otherwise quiescent muscle stem cells become activated through exposure to extrinsic, pro-myogenic stimuli and switch to a highly proliferative state. Activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells depends on expression of two transcriptional regulators, myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) and myogenic determintation protein (MYOD), and preceedes commitment to differentiation. Downregulation of PAX7 and expression of myogenin (MYOG) in a subset of activated muscle stem cells induces differentiation and ultimately leads cell-cycle exit and formation of myoblasts that fuse with other myoblasts or existing muscle fibres to repair the muscle. Activated stem cells may also inhibit MYOD expression and re-instating quiescence, thereby replenishing the pool of muscle stem cells for future muscle repair.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder with severe features of muscle weakness and decrease in the mass of a muscle (muscle wasting, atrophy). Dystrophin, the gene product causing DMD in affected individuals, plays a pivotal role in anchoring muscle fibres to the extracellular matrix, thereby allowing force to be transmitted to the skeletal parts of the muscle. Dystrophic fibres are prone to damage by mechanical stress and die after repeated muscle contraction. Such fibres are often replaced by fibrotic, adipose or connective tissue that is not able to transmit sufficient muscular force. Muscle degeneration elicits repair by expansion and differentiation of stem cells, but regenerated muscle fibres also lack a functional dystophin such that chronic cycles of degeneration and regeneration are passed through. Until now, the role of muscle stem cells in DMD remains elusive, with only some evidence for specialized roles of dystrohin during the stem cell division mechanism but as well hints to an important role of the pathological environment for disease progression.

A genetic and experimental model of DMD is the *mdx* mouse, whose muscles retain a lifelong capacity to regenerate fibres and exhibits loss of muscle fibres and extensive fibrosis. Recently, it was shown that germline inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 in chronically regenerating mdx mice develop rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (Camboni et al., 2012; Chamberlain et al., 2007), a rare and aggressive childhood cancer and the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents (El Demellawy et al., 2017).
