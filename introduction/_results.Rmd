This thesis provides methodological development in three areas of cancer bioinformatics, targeting detection and quantification of miRNAs, analysis of CpG-site methylation as an epigenetic mechanism and characterization of the cellular and molecular basis of cancer. 


### Graph-based and reference-free miRNA detection and quantification

### Analysis of DNA methylation 

### Genomic analysis of fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma

### Cancer insights / Conclusion
