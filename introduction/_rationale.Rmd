Cancer has repeatedly been reported to be one of the leading causes of death and it is even the leading cause of death for children and adolescents around the world [@steliarova-foucherInternationalIncidenceChildhood2017], being responsible for nearly 10 million deaths in 2018. Cancer is however not a single disease entity, but merely a complex disease that can arise in multiple tissues, originating from multiple cell types and mechanisms, emerging as more than 100 distinct cancer types from interactions of hundreds to thousands of macromolecules. Although recent decades have witnessed the generation of unarguably valuable molecular knowledge from a myriad of molecular biology-based investigations, understanding of many aspects of variation in cancer initiation, progression, severity, and resistance against treatment is lacking [@nurseEndsUnderstanding1997;@koutsogiannouliComplexityCancerBiology2013;]. 

The initial sequencing of the human genome [@internationalhumangenomesequencingconsortiumInitialSequencingAnalysis2001;] has additionally marked the beginning of the (cancer) genomics era and provided the foundation for modern biomedical research. The following decade have witnessed disruptive advances in DNA sequencing technology, revolutionizing not only cancer research [@macconaillExistingEmergingTechnologies2013], but also the way how genome-wide questions can be answered. *Next generation sequencing* (NGS) technolgy enabled profiling of cancer genomes [@stephensComplexLandscapesSomatic2009;@pughMedulloblastomaExomeSequencing2012] and significantly enhanced the ability to study neoplastic transformation based on changes in the genome sequence, but as well introduced challenges in computational data analysis [@mardisDecadePerspectiveDNA2011; @wuCancerBioinformaticsNew2012] and transformation of the gained knowledge into an holistic understanding of cancer as a complex and dynamic system [@grizziCancerInitiationProgression2006; @sigstonEmergenceFrameworkCarcinogenesis2017].

The complex and dynamic nature of cancer results in large intertumor heterogeneity and is one of the biggest challenges hampering successful treatment of cancer. Integration of patient data from multiple sources (e.g. genomics, epigenomics, clinical data, etc.) aims to distinguish patients with similar perceived cancer types but different requirements for positive treatment response based on their cellular and molecular underpinnings. Tailoring treatment to individual patients has been fittingly termed *personalized medicine* or *precision oncology* [@vincentComingEraPrecision2017;@senftPrecisionOncologyRoad2017] and requires integrative multi-omics approaches to identify therapeutic targets that function during tumor initiation or progression. To fulfill requirements of precision oncology and correctly inform clinical decision making, appropriate computational methods for managing, integrating and analyzing large and complex data are needed.
