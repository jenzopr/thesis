### Somatic mutations transform cells into cancer cells {#smt}

While normal cells retain their ability to control the production and release of growth-promoting signals and thereby provide tissue architecture and homeostasis of cell number, cancer cells are characterised by chronic proliferation and constant re-entry into the growth-and-division cycle. The somatic mutation theory postulates that molecular events such as genomic mutations preceed cell transformation and provide the cell with the ability to overcome cell control mechanisms. By such, transformed cancers cells are able to e.g. escape the control of growth supressors, bypass mechanism of induced cell death, delay or avoid entry into cell senescence, induce angiogenesis and/or alter cell-to-cell contacts to activate invasion of surrounding tissue. At the core of this theory, mutations in so-called master genes (e.g. oncogenes or tumor supressor genes) constitute the origin of cancer.
Molecular alterations in a single somatic cell are passed onto its progeny and therefore must be heritable to enable clonal expansion (at least define this) and promote cancer growth by sequential accumulation of transforming changes. The mechanism of heredity is not limited to genetic alterations but can also be of epigenetic origin, i.e. based on changes in methylation, acetylation or chromatin structure as well (xref). Importantly, heredity exposes cancer cells to natural selection and enables evolutionary mechanisms to act on cancer development.

The search for transformation-causing genome alterations accelerated through recent advances in high-throughput technologies which led to an impressive accumulation of data from large-scale genome sequencing projects like the [Cancer Genome Project](cancer.sanger.ac.uk) or [The Cancer Genome Atlas](cancergenome.nih.gov). Collectively, both projects list 77 million simple somatic mutations across cancer genomes from nearly 25,000 individuals in the International Cancer Genome Consortium [Data Portal Release 27](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/release_27). However, the search did not reveal a single pattern of genetic alterations that is universal to most cancers. Instead, a tremendous genetic heterogeneity in underlying mechanisms of cancer formation emerged, despite very similar phenotypes.

Following the observed genetic heterogeneity among cancer and even within similar cancer types, it can be reasoned that most individual tumors exhibit different genome contexts with genomic alterations in e.g. genes, regulatory elements or genomic topology. Genome context is largely defined by a cells karyotype and together, both observations provide an underpinning for observed heterogeneity in cancer.
The Genome Theory extends the somatic mutation theory by karyotype heterogeneity and the process of natural selection into a new theory on how somatic cells evolve within individual patients [@hengEvolutionaryMechanismCancer2010]. At the core of the evolutionary mechanism is genome context instability induced by internal (e.g. elicited through somatic mutations) or external (e.g. treatment, environment) stress. As a consequence, genetic or epigenetic alterations increase cell population heterogeneity to ultimately enable natural selection of somatic cells showing high fitness in terms of survival or proliferation. The evolutionary mechanism happens in two steps of karyotypic evolution:
1) the punctuated (unstable) phase, characterised by high genome-level heterogeneity between individual cells and
2) the stepwise (relatively stable) phase, where dominant karyotypes emerge and accumulate minor modifications over time.

The occurence of genome-level alterations in an instable genome context is a stochastic process and therefore the probability of successful progression towards cancer is highest through alterations significantly impacting a cells phenotype. Concomitantly, the stochastic nature complicates the prediction of which pathway will become dominant prior to tumor formation and renders the characterization of individual cancer pathways less meaningful. Ultimately, it impedes the establishment of a general model of cancer origin and obscures understanding of how cancer can be managed in classical clinical treatment.
