# Introduction

Here is a brief introduction into using _R Markdown_. _Markdown_ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. _R Markdown_ provides the flexibility of _Markdown_ with the implementation of **R** input and output.  For more details on using _R Markdown_ see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Be careful with your spacing in _Markdown_ documents.  While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give _Markdown_ signals as to how to proceed.  As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph.  In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).

## Lists

It's easy to create a list.  It can be unordered like

* Item 1
* Item 2

or it can be ordered like

1. Item 1
4. Item 2

Notice that I intentionally mislabeled Item 2 as number 4.  _Markdown_ automatically figures this out!  You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list.  Check it out below.

To create a sublist, just indent the values a bit (at least four spaces or a tab).  (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b

## Line breaks

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:*

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

## R chunks

When you click the **Knit** button above a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document. You can embed an **R** code chunk like this (`cars` is a built-in **R** dataset):

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Inline code

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`. 

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.  More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].  

## Including plots

You can also embed plots.  For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo=FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of other ways to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.  

Another useful chunk option is the setting of `cache=TRUE` as you see here.  If document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations or plots that are expensive to generate you can use knitr caching to improve performance.  Later in this file, you'll see a way to reference plots created in **R** or external figures.
