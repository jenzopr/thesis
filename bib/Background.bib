Biomedical literature currently increases at a rate of several thousand papers per week, making automated information retrieval methods the only feasible method of managing this expanding corpus. With the increasing prevalence of open-access journals and constant growth of publicly-available repositories of biomedical literature, literature mining has become much more effective with respect to the extraction of biomedically-relevant data. In recent years, text mining of popular databases such as MEDLINE has evolved from basic term-searches to more sophisticated natural language processing techniques, indexing and retrieval methods, structural analysis and integration of literature with associated metadata. In this review, we will focus on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a computational linguistics technique increasingly used for a variety of biological purposes. It is noted for its ability to consistently outperform benchmark Boolean text searches and co-occurrence models at information retrieval and its power to extract indirect relationships within a data set. LSI has been used successfully to formulate new hypotheses, generate novel connections from existing data, and validate empirical data.},

  abstract = {Summary
Human hematopoiesis involves cellular differentiation of multipotent cells into progressively more lineage-restricted states. While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract = {Steering the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) toward specific cell types is crucial for patient-specific disease modeling and drug testing. This effort requires the capacity to predict and control when and how multipotent progenitor cells commit to the desired cell fate. Cell fate commitment represents a critical state transition or ``tipping point'' at which complex systems undergo a sudden qualitative shift. To characterize such transitions during iPSC to cardiomyocyte differentiation, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 96 developmental genes at single-cell resolution. We identified a bifurcation event early in the trajectory when a primitive streak-like cell population segregated into the mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Before this branching point, we could detect the signature of an imminent critical transition: increase in cell heterogeneity and coordination of gene expression. Correlation analysis of gene expression profiles at the tipping point indicates transcription factors that drive the state transition toward each alternative cell fate and their relationships with specific phenotypic readouts. The latter helps us to facilitate small molecule screening for differentiation efficiency. To this end, we set up an analysis of cell population structure at the tipping point after systematic variation of the protocol to bias the differentiation toward mesodermal or endodermal cell lineage. We were able to predict the proportion of cardiomyocytes many days before cells manifest the differentiated phenotype. The analysis of cell populations undergoing a critical state transition thus affords a tool to forecast cell fate outcomes and can be used to optimize differentiation protocols to obtain desired cell populations.},

  abstract = {Embryonic development is a crucial period in the life of a multicellular organism, during which limited sets of embryonic progenitors produce all cells in the adult body. Determining which fate these progenitors acquire in adult tissues requires the simultaneous measurement of clonal history and cell identity at single-cell resolution, which has been a major challenge. Clonal history has traditionally been investigated by microscopically tracking cells during development1,2, monitoring the heritable expression of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins3 and, more recently, using next-generation sequencing technologies that exploit somatic mutations4, microsatellite instability5, transposon tagging6, viral barcoding7, CRISPR\textendash{}Cas9 genome editing8,9,10,11,12,13 and Cre\textendash{}loxP recombination14. Single-cell transcriptomics15 provides a powerful platform for unbiased cell-type classification. Here we present ScarTrace, a single-cell sequencing strategy that enables the simultaneous quantification of clonal history and cell type for thousands of cells obtained from different organs of the adult zebrafish. Using ScarTrace, we show that a small set of multipotent embryonic progenitors generate all haematopoietic cells in the kidney marrow, and that many progenitors produce specific cell types in the eyes and brain. In addition, we study when embryonic progenitors commit to the left or right eye. ScarTrace reveals that epidermal and mesenchymal cells in the caudal fin arise from the same progenitors, and that osteoblast-restricted precursors can produce mesenchymal cells during regeneration. Furthermore, we identify resident immune cells in the fin with a distinct clonal origin from other blood cell types. We envision that similar approaches will have major applications in other experimental systems, in which the matching of embryonic clonal origin to adult cell type will ultimately allow reconstruction of how the adult body is built from a single cell.},

However, computational methods linking this heterogeneity to biases towards distinct cell fates are not well established. Here, we perform deep single-cell transcriptome sequencing of \textasciitilde{}2,000 bone-marrow derived mouse hematopoietic progenitors enriched for lymphoid lineages. To resolve subtle transcriptome priming indicative of distinct lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias. FateID delineates domains of fate bias within progenitor populations and permits the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays. We expect that FateID will enhance our understanding of the process of cell fate choice in complex multi-lineage differentiation systems.},

This method finds lower dimensional embeddings of data points while minimizing distortions in distances between neighboring data points. By construction, t-SNE discards information about large scale structure of the data. We show that adding a global cost function to the t-SNE cost function makes it possible to cluster the data while preserving global inter-cluster data structure. We test the new "global t-SNE" (g-SNE) method on one synthetic and two real data sets on flowers and human brain cells which have significant and meaningful global structures. In all cases, g-SNE outperforms t-SNE in preserving the global structure. The weight parameter {$\lambda$} of the global cost function determines the balance between local and global distances preservations. For the human brain atlas data set, we show the tradeoff of {$\lambda$} in representing global structure of data. Using g-SNE with the optimized {$\lambda$} may therefore yield biological insights into how data is organized on multiple scales.},

  volume = {73},
  issn = {0027-8424},
  abstract = {A definitive test for developmental totipotency of mouse malignant teratocarcinoma cells was conducted by cloning singly injected cells in genetically marked blastocysts. Totipotency was conclusively shown in an adult mosaic female whose tumor-strain cells had made substantial contributions to all of the wide range of its somatic tissues analyzed; the clonally propagated cell lineage had therefore differentiated in numerous normal directions. The test cells were from "cores" of embryoid bodies of a euploid, chromosomally male (X/Y), ascites tumor grown only in vivo by transplantation for 8 years. The capacity of cells from the same source to differentiate, in a phenotypic male, into reproductively functional sperms, has been shown in our previous experiments [(1975) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 3585-3589]. Cells from this transplant line therefore provide material suitable for projected somatic and germ-line genetic analyses of mammalian differentiation based on "cycling" of mutation-carrying tumor cells through developing embryos. In some animals obtained from single-cell injections tumor-derived cells were sporadically distributed in developmentally unrelated tissues. These cases can be accounted for by delayed and haphazard cellular integration, and by a marked degree of sustained cellular developmental flexibility in early mammalian development, irrespective of certain classical "germ-layer" designations. All mosaic mice obtained have thus far been free of teratomas. In one case, the injected stem cell contributed only to the pancreas and gave rise to a malignancy resembling pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The high modal frequency of euploidy in these individually tested cells thus tends to indicate that a near-normal chromosome complement is sufficient for total restoration of orderly gene expression in a normal embryonic environment; it may also be necessary for teratoma stem-cell proliferation to be terminated there.},

  abstract = {Fibrotic lung tissue shows increased connective tissue deposition and fibroblast proliferation and in addition a substantial increase in mast cell numbers in and around the fibrotic area. To elucidate the question of whether products of mast cells affect the proliferative behaviour of structural cells in the lung and thereby contribute to fibrogenesis, the effect of histamine, a prominent mast cell derived mediator, on the in vitro proliferation of primary cultures of normal adult human lung fibroblasts was studied. Histamine enhanced fibroblast proliferation in a dose dependent manner, with an optimum effect at a physiological concentration of 10(-7) mol/l. This effect occurred when cells were exposed to histamine at restricted times during cell growth and was shown to depend in part on the stage of the cell cycle reached by the fibroblasts. The histamine induced proliferation was mediated through an H2 histamine receptor on the fibroblast, being inhibited by cimetidine, an H2 antagonist, and not by pyrilamine maleate, an antagonist of the H1 receptor. Mast cell products such as histamine may interact with and promote the increased fibroblast proliferation found in pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small 21\&ndash;24 nucleotide RNAs that are capable of regulating multiple signaling pathways across multiple tissues. MicroRNAs are dynamically regulated and change in expression levels during periods of early development, tissue regeneration, cancer, and various other disease states. Recently, microRNAs have been isolated from whole serum and muscle biopsies to identify unique diagnostic signatures for specific neuromuscular disease states. Functional studies of microRNAs in cell lines and animal models of neuromuscular diseases have elucidated their importance in contributing to neuromuscular disease progression and pathologies. The ability of microRNAs to alter the expression of an entire signaling pathway opens up their unique ability to be used as potential therapeutic entry points for the treatment of disease. Here, we will review the recent findings of key microRNAs and their dysregulation in various neuromuscular diseases. Additionally, we will highlight the current strategies being used to regulate the expression of key microRNAs as they have become important players in the clinical treatment of some of the neuromuscular diseases.},

  title = {Chromosomal and Genetic Imbalances in {{Chinese}} Patients with Rhabdomyosarcoma Detected by High-Resolution Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization},
  volume = {7},
  issn = {1936-2625},
  abstract = {Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Although associations between ARMS tumorigenesis and PAX3, PAX7, and FKHR are well recognized, the complete genetic etiology underlying RMS pathogenesis and progression remains unclear. Chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) and the involved genes may play important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of human malignancies. Using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we examined 20 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) RMS tumors to explore the involvement of the relevant chromosomal regions with resident genes in RMS tumorigenesis. In RMS, frequent gains were identified on chromosome regions 12q13.3-q14.1, 12q24.31, 17q25.1, 1q21.1, and 7q11.23, whereas frequent losses were observed on chromosome regions 5q13.2, 14q32.33, and 15q11.2. Amplifications were observed on chromosome regions 9p13.3, 12q13.3-q14.1, 12q15, and 16p13.11, whereas deletions were detected on chromosome regions 1p36.33, 1p13.1, 2q11.1, 5q13.2, 8p23.1, 9p24.3, and 16p11.2. Frequent gains were detected in GLI1, GEFT, OS9, and CDK4 (12q13.3-q14.1), being 60\% in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and 66.67\% in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), respectively. However, frequent losses were detected in IGHG1, IGHM, IGHG3, and IGHG4 (14q32.33), being 70\% in ERMS and 55.56\% in and ARMS, respectively. Frequent gains were detected in TYROBP, HCST, LRFN3, and ALKBH6 (19q13.12) in ERMS but not in ARMS. The frequency of TYROBP, HCST, LRFN3, and ALKBH6 gains is significantly different in ERMS versus ARMS (P=0.011). The results suggest that novel TYROBP, HCST, LRFN3, and ALKBH6 genes may play important roles in ERMS. The technique used is a feasible approach for array comparative genomic hybridization analysis in archival tumor samples.},

KDM4 expression is tightly regulated to insure proper function in diverse biological processes, such as cellular differentiation. Mounting evidence has shown that disrupting KDM4 expression is implicated in the establishment and progression of multiple diseases including cancer. In particular, genomic regions encoding the KDM4A, B and C genes are often amplified, disrupting normal cellular proliferation. Furthermore, KDM4 demethylases are promising druggable targets. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in characterizing the structures and regulatory mechanisms of KDM4 proteins, as well as our current understanding of their alterations and roles in tumorigenesis. We also review the reported KDM4 inhibitors and discuss their potential as therapeutic agents.},

@article{cooleyNovelMetricReveals2019,
  title = {A Novel Metric Reveals Previously Unrecognized Distortion in Dimensionality Reduction of {{scRNA}}-{{Seq}} Data},
  abstract = {High-dimensional data are becoming increasingly common in nearly all areas of science. Developing approaches to analyze these data and understand their meaning is a pressing issue. This is particularly true for the rapidly growing field of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), a technique that simultaneously measures the expression of tens of thousands of genes in thousands to millions of single cells. The emerging consensus for analysis workflows reduces the dimensionality of the dataset before performing downstream analysis, such as assignment of cell types. One problem with this approach is that dimensionality reduction can introduce substantial distortion into the data; consider the familiar example of trying to represent the three-dimensional earth as a two-dimensional map. It is currently unclear if such distortion affects analysis of scRNA-Seq data sets.  Here, we introduce a straightforward approach to quantifying this distortion by comparing the local neighborhoods of points before and after dimensionality reduction. We found that popular techniques like t-SNE and UMAP introduce significant distortion even for relatively simple geometries such as simulated hyperspheres. For scRNA-Seq data, we found the distortion in local neighborhoods was greater than 95\% in the 2- and 3-dimensional space typically used for downstream analysis. This high level of distortion can readily introduce important errors into cell type identification, pseudotime ordering, and other analyses that rely on local relationships. We found that principal component analysis can generate accurate embeddings of the data, but only when using dimensionalities that are much higher than typically used in scRNA-Seq analysis. We suggest approaches to take these findings into account and call for a new generation of dimensional reduction algorithms that can accurately embed high dimensional data in its true latent dimension.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional data, such as those generated using single-cell RNA sequencing, present challenges in interpretation and visualization. Numerical and computational methods for dimensionality reduction allow for low-dimensional representation of genome-scale expression data for downstream clustering, trajectory reconstruction, and biological interpretation. However, a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the performance of these techniques has not been established. We present an unbiased framework that defines metrics of global and local structure preservation in dimensionality reduction transformations. Using discrete and continuous scRNA-seq datasets, we find that input cell distribution and method parameters are largely determinant of global, local, and organizational data structure preservation by eleven published dimensionality reduction methods.
