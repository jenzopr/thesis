  title = {Chromosomal and Genetic Imbalances in {{Chinese}} Patients with Rhabdomyosarcoma Detected by High-Resolution Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization},
  volume = {7},
  issn = {1936-2625},
  abstract = {Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Although associations between ARMS tumorigenesis and PAX3, PAX7, and FKHR are well recognized, the complete genetic etiology underlying RMS pathogenesis and progression remains unclear. Chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) and the involved genes may play important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of human malignancies. Using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we examined 20 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) RMS tumors to explore the involvement of the relevant chromosomal regions with resident genes in RMS tumorigenesis. In RMS, frequent gains were identified on chromosome regions 12q13.3-q14.1, 12q24.31, 17q25.1, 1q21.1, and 7q11.23, whereas frequent losses were observed on chromosome regions 5q13.2, 14q32.33, and 15q11.2. Amplifications were observed on chromosome regions 9p13.3, 12q13.3-q14.1, 12q15, and 16p13.11, whereas deletions were detected on chromosome regions 1p36.33, 1p13.1, 2q11.1, 5q13.2, 8p23.1, 9p24.3, and 16p11.2. Frequent gains were detected in GLI1, GEFT, OS9, and CDK4 (12q13.3-q14.1), being 60\% in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and 66.67\% in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), respectively. However, frequent losses were detected in IGHG1, IGHM, IGHG3, and IGHG4 (14q32.33), being 70\% in ERMS and 55.56\% in and ARMS, respectively. Frequent gains were detected in TYROBP, HCST, LRFN3, and ALKBH6 (19q13.12) in ERMS but not in ARMS. The frequency of TYROBP, HCST, LRFN3, and ALKBH6 gains is significantly different in ERMS versus ARMS (P=0.011). The results suggest that novel TYROBP, HCST, LRFN3, and ALKBH6 genes may play important roles in ERMS. The technique used is a feasible approach for array comparative genomic hybridization analysis in archival tumor samples.},

  abstract = {KDM4 histone demethylases catalyze the removal of methyl marks from histone lysine residues to epigenetically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. KDM4 expression is tightly regulated to insure proper function in diverse biological processes, such as cellular differentiation. Mounting evidence has shown that disrupting KDM4 expression is implicated in the establishment and progression of multiple diseases including cancer. In particular, genomic regions encoding the KDM4A, B and C genes are often amplified, disrupting normal cellular proliferation. Furthermore, KDM4 demethylases are promising druggable targets. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in characterizing the structures and regulatory mechanisms of KDM4 proteins, as well as our current understanding of their alterations and roles in tumorigenesis. We also review the reported KDM4 inhibitors and discuss their potential as therapeutic agents.},
